# Clean Todo

A simple todo app organized according to the [Clean Architecture](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-architecture-a/9780134494272/).

## Why?
Clean architecture and its derivatives, [DDD](), [Hexagon](), [Ports and Adapters](), etc.(?) are kind of challenging, especially for a relative novice like myself. I'm writing this as a way to learn more about the principles of the architecture.
